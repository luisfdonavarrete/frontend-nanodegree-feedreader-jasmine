# Project Overview

# Feed Reader Testing
Fifth project for Udacity Front-end Nanodegree

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, but the application had an incomplete test suite. 
Coding the test suite required me to explore the application to understand of how it works.


# These tests were implemented

1. Test that the allFeeds object has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Test that the allFeeds object has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. Test that the menu element is hidden by default.
4. Test that the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
5. Test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
8. Test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
